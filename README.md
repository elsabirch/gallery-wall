#Gallery Wall 

is the project of Elsa Birch while a student at Hackbright Academy in San Francisco... stay tuned.

Still very much a work in progress! But if you'd like to try running the app locally, these steps may help:

1. Create virtualenv using requirements and activate it

2. create a psql database called gallerywall

3. Run seed_database.py

4. Run server.py

5. Head to "http://localhost:5000/" in your browser!
